Workspace
=========

For general informations about the Blender Workspaces see the respective 
`Workspaces <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/workspaces.html>`__ section in Blender documentation.

After installation of Bonsai the default Blender start-up screen looks different from the standard Blender interface.

Bonsai adds the **BIM** Workspace to the interface and by default activates this workspace on start-up.
It also modifies the layout of views and sidebars and adds custom functionality to the toolbar.
The left **Outliner** panel shows a tree of geometric objects. The centre main **Viewport** panel shows 3D geometry.
The right **Properties** panel shows data and relationships.
